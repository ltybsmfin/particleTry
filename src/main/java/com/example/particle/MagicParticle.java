 * A client-side visual effect with position, velocity, collision, and additional render properties.

 * Each particle is typically rendered as a camera-facing texture quad.
 * {@link net.minecraft.client.particle.SpriteBillboardParticle} provides this behavior, and most vanilla particles inherit from it.
 *
 * <p>
 * If you would like a particle with no direct rendering effects, inherit from {@link NoRenderParticle}.
